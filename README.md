# WP Offload S3 - Filter Image File Types

Filters [WP Offload S3](http://t.deliciousbrains.com/SH4q) created by [Delicious Brains Inc](http://t.deliciousbrains.com/SH4q) by stopping images from uploading to your S3 bucket.

This is great for those who are wanting better SEO Image search results as the images will be loading from your site and not from your S3 bucket.
