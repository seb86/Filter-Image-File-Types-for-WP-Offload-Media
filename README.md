## Overview üîî

> Originally called "WP Offload S3 ‚Äì Filter Image File Types" but had to be changed for trademark reasons.

This plugin stops only images from uploading directly to your [Amazon S3](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/), [DigitalOcean Spaces](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/spaces/) or [Google Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage/) by filtering [WP Offload Media](https://deliciousbrains.com/wp-offload-media/). All other media file types continue to upload.

This is great for those who are wanting better SEO image search results as the images will be loading from your site and not from your CDN of choice.
